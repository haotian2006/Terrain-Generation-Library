Minecraft terrain emulator

Ported from [https://github.com/misode/deepslate](https://github.com/misode/deepslate).
Transpiled by Haotian2006 from typescript into luau. 
Was originally gonna use it for my game but decided it would be a hassle 
to make custom worldgen functions, So I decided to work on a custom system instead and open source this one. 
Only Features that were ported from DeepSlate is the world generation and getting biomes from points.  

USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
