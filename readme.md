# Minecraft terrain emulator and noise generator 

Ported from [https://github.com/misode/deepslate](https://github.com/misode/deepslate).
Transpiled by Haotian2006 from typescript into luau. 
Was originally gonna use it for my game but decided it would be a hassle 
to make custom worldgen functions , So I decided to work on a custom system instead and open source this one. 
Only Features that were ported from DeepSlate is the world generation and getting biomes from points.  

Test Place: [https://www.roblox.com/games/15502792299/DeepSlate-Test](https://www.roblox.com/games/15502792299/DeepSlate-Test)

make a copy of it by going to the 3 dots and clicking edit in studio.

If you do plan to use this I highly recommend making custom WorldGen functions.
Instead of using minecraft's

An example of what they look like is show in studio and in the 
worldgenExample folder (not Deepslate's worldgen)

you can also create custom functions here: [https://misode.github.io/worldgen/density-function/](https://misode.github.io/worldgen/density-function/)
(use a json to lua table converter to convert it to a table format)

also fyi I do not have any plans to update this library

## USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
