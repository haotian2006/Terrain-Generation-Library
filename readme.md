Minecraft terrain emulator

Ported from [https://github.com/misode/deepslate](https://github.com/misode/deepslate).
Transpiled by Haotian2006 from typescript into luau. 
Was originally gonna use it for my game but decided it would be a hassle 
to make custom worldgen functions, So I decided to work on a custom system instead and open source this one. 
Only Features that were ported from DeepSlate is the world generation and getting biomes from points.  

Test Place: [https://www.roblox.com/games/15502792299/DeepSlate-Test](https://www.roblox.com/games/15502792299/DeepSlate-Test)

make a copy of it by going to the 3 dots and clicking edit in studio.

If you do plan to use this I highly recommend making custom WorldGen functions. A example is show in studio and in the worldgenExample folder
(not Deepslate.worldgen)

you can create custom functions here: [https://misode.github.io/worldgen/density-function/](https://misode.github.io/worldgen/density-function/)
(use a json to lua table converter if you do plan to use it)

USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
